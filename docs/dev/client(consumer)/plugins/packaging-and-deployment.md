# Packaging And Deployment

A plugin can be built into the main `opamp-consumer` package or shipped as a
separate Python package. The separate package route is usually better for a new
agent integration because it avoids changing the base consumer release every
time the plugin changes.

## In-Repo Built-In Plugin

Use this route when the plugin is intended to become part of the base consumer.

Add the package under:

```text
consumer/src/opamp_consumer/my_agent/
```

Then add an entry point to `consumer/pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."opamp_consumer.plugins"]
my_agent = "opamp_consumer.my_agent.client:main"
```

Because the consumer wheel includes `src/opamp_consumer`, the new package will
be included in the consumer wheel as long as it lives under that package tree.

## External Plugin Package

Use this route when the plugin should deploy independently.

Minimal structure:

```text
my-consumer-plugin/
  pyproject.toml
  src/
    my_consumer_plugin/
      __init__.py
      client.py
  tests/
```

Minimal `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=1.25"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "my-consumer-plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
  "opamp-consumer>=0.4.1",
]

[project.entry-points."opamp_consumer.plugins"]
my_agent = "my_consumer_plugin.client:main"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/my_consumer_plugin"]
```

Build the wheel with:

```bash
python -m build --wheel
```

Install the base consumer first, then the plugin:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade opamp-consumer
python -m pip install --upgrade ./dist/my_consumer_plugin-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The order matters because the plugin imports consumer APIs and registers an
entry point into the consumer's plugin group.

## Runtime Config

If the plugin has an installed entry point, runtime config only needs to select
the service type:

```json
{
  "consumer": {
    "service_type": "my_agent"
  }
}
```

You can still include a config overlay when you want the config file to own the
mapping explicitly:

```json
{
  "consumer": {
    "service_type": "my_agent",
    "plugins": [
      {
        "service_type": "my_agent",
        "entry_point": "my_consumer_plugin.client:main",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To disable an installed plugin without uninstalling it:

```json
{
  "consumer": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "service_type": "my_agent",
        "enabled": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deployment Container

The deployment test container already understands external plugin packages.
See the [deployment test container docs](../../../../tests/test-containers/opamp-consumer-deployment/README.md).

The key setting is:

```env
CONSUMER_PLUGIN_INSTALLS=/host-assets/dist/my_consumer_plugin-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The container installs packages in this order:

1. base `opamp-consumer` wheel
2. external plugin wheels or requirement specs from `CONSUMER_PLUGIN_INSTALLS`
3. entry-point verification
4. config staging
5. `opamp-consumer` launch

That order matches the recommended production deployment pattern.

## Checking Installed Entry Points

After installation, verify the entry point is visible in the same Python
environment that will run `opamp-consumer`:

```bash
python -c "from importlib import metadata; print([ep.name + '=' + ep.value for ep in metadata.entry_points().select(group='opamp_consumer.plugins')])"
```

You should see `my_agent=my_consumer_plugin.client:main` in the output.

If the entry point is missing, check:

- the plugin package was installed into the same environment as the consumer
- the package metadata contains `[project.entry-points."opamp_consumer.plugins"]`
- the wheel was rebuilt after editing `pyproject.toml`
- an active `consumer.plugins` entry has not disabled the same `service_type`

## Versioning And Compatibility

Pin the plugin's minimum `opamp-consumer` version to the first consumer version
that contains the APIs you use. If you use newer helpers such as
`ConsumerPluginConfigContext` or the startup banner, reflect that in the
dependency range.

For production, prefer an explicit compatible range, for example:

```toml
dependencies = [
  "opamp-consumer>=0.4.1,<0.5",
]
```

Use the looser form during local development only when you are intentionally
tracking the current repo.
