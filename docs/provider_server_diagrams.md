# Provider Server Diagrams Guide

This page explains the rendered provider/server diagrams and links each one back to Mermaid source and related docs.

## Diagram 1: Class and Module Relationships

![Provider class and module relationships](provider_server_diagram_1.png)

What this shows:

- `server.py` bootstraps config and starts Quart.
- `app.py` owns OpAMP transport handlers, REST/UI endpoints, and response building.
- `state.py` (`STORE`) is the in-memory source of truth for client records and queued commands.
- `commands.py` and command implementation classes build command/custom payload shapes.
- `mcptool` route and transport bridge modules expose MCP and integrate auth checks for MCP ASGI traffic.

## Diagram 2: Runtime Entrypoints and Transport

![Provider runtime entrypoints and transport](provider_server_diagram_2.png)

What this shows:

- Script/CLI entrypoints into `opamp_provider.server`.
- Startup path through config load, store defaults, and `app.run(...)`.
- Conditional startup mode:
  - HTTP when `provider.tls` is absent, or when `provider.tls.enabled=false`.
  - HTTPS when `provider.tls` is present and enabled with `provider.tls.cert_file` and `provider.tls.key_file` configured.
- Parallel request surfaces: OpAMP HTTP, OpAMP WebSocket, and REST/UI/tool APIs.

## Diagram 3: Command Queue and Dispatch Pipeline

![Provider command queue and dispatch pipeline](provider_server_diagram_3.png)

What this shows:

- How `/api/clients/<client_id>/commands` normalizes input and queues `CommandRecord` entries.
- Where command object factories are used for concrete command types.
- How pending commands are consumed on the next client check-in and encoded as:
  - `ServerToAgent.command`
  - `ServerToAgent.custom_message`
  - or `ServerToAgent.flags` (full-state resync)
- How sent commands are marked complete in store state.

## Diagram 4: Auth and MCP Transport Routing

![Provider auth and transport routing](provider_server_diagram_4.png)

What this shows:

- HTTP route protection via `@app.before_request` and `evaluate_bearer_auth(...)`.
- MCP ASGI protection via `register_mcp_transport(...)` wrapper and `evaluate_asgi_scope_auth(...)`.
- The difference between protected MCP/tool paths and the protocol handling path for `/v1/opamp` WebSocket.
