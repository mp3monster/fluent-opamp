- [Server_(provider) diagrams (as images)](provider_server_diagrams.md) — rendered provider/server diagrams plus links to auth, endpoints, and command docs.
- [Client (consumer) use of mixins](consumer_mixins.md) — how consumer mixins are composed, dispatched, and overridden.
- [Client (consumer) custom_handlers](consumer_custom_handlers.md) — built-in custom handlers, runtime discovery, and how to implement/deploy additional handlers.
- [Client (consumer)_update_controllers](consumer_update_controllers.md) — how full update controllers drive reporting flags and outbound message field cadence.
- [Authentication](authentication.md) — bearer token auth modes, static-token setup, Keycloak/JWT setup, and MCP token usage.
- [Web Endpoints](endpoints.md) — provider endpoint inventory, including UI/API/tool/MCP routes and `/doc-set`.
- [OpAMP Config Catalog UI](opamp_config_catalog_ui.md) — configuration-driven catalog index page and help route details.
- [OpAMP Config Catalog Service Prompt](opamp_config_catalog_service_prompt.md) — implementation prompt and scope for the catalog service.
- [UI Consistency Checklist](ui_consistency_checklist.md) — PR checklist for consistent UI architecture, libraries, routing, and verification.
- [Self_signed_TLS_setup](self_signed_tls_setup.md) — generate local self-signed cert/key and apply config values for HTTPS testing.
- [API_gateway_suggested use and requirements](api_gateway_requirements.md) — recommended API gateway controls, internal vs external client profiles, and required auth/route hardening updates.
- [Service_daemon_setup](service_daemon_setup.md) — running provider/consumer as `systemd` or Windows services, including Fluent Bit/Fluentd launch permissions.
- [Client README](../consumer/README.md) — client/agent (aka consumer) configuration and CLI usage.
- [Server README](../provider/README.md) — server (aka provider) configuration and web UI notes.
- [Server state persistence](../provider/README.md#state-persistence-and-restore) — snapshot naming, `--restore` usage, fallback behavior, and retention.
- [MCP scripts and usage](../mcp/README.md) — MCP wrapper/canonical script behavior, FastMCP client role, command-line parameters, and verification.
- [Agent broker README](../agent_broker/README.md) — optional standalone conversation broker overview and run steps.
- [Agent broker docs index](../agent_broker/docs/README.md) — broker runbooks (startup/shutdown/logging, Slack setup, architecture notes).
- [Scripts](scripts.md) — script reference table by platform.
- [Component Versioning](component_versioning.md) — git commit/date version metadata and where it appears in CLI/UI help.

## Optional components

- `agent_broker` is optional and runs as a separate process.
- Provider/server and consumer/client do not require the broker to run.
- If used, start and stop the broker independently from provider and consumer.

## Documentation Rules

- Treat `dev-notes/` as internal working notes only.
- Do not cross reference `dev-notes/` content from formal project documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`, component READMEs, broker docs, or UI help pages).

## Project layout (quick view)

- `agent_broker` — optional standalone conversation broker package and docs.
- `config` — default configuration files (including `opamp.json`).
- `consumer` — the OpAMP consumer (client) package, tests, and config samples.
- `dist` — SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and Wheel files
- `docs` — project documentation.
- `logs` — runtime logs created by scripts.
- `server-state` — state snapshot folder created when provider state persistence writes snapshots (folder name follows `provider.state_persistence.state_file_prefix` parent path).
- `proto` — protobuf definitions and generated artifacts.
- `provider` — the OpAMP provider (server) package, UI, and tests.
- `scripts` — helper run and shutdown scripts.
- `shared` — shared utilities used by provider/consumer.
- `src` — top-level Python package glue (if needed for tooling).
- `tests` — repository-level tests.
