# OpAMP Feature Completion, ToDos and Future Features
The following represents a brain dump of things that we want to/need to do. The ToDos are the primary focus, but may not be delivered immediately as we work toward a minimal implementation.

## OpAMP Features

The following is a summary of the features  based on the message exchange and the progress made, gaps and things that aren't in our plans.

### Client to Server

Here's a markdown table with one row per `AgentToServer` message field:

| Field                         | Spec Status | Implementation Status | Spec Description                                             | Implementation Notes                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `instance_uid`                | Stable      | Done                  | Globally unique identifier of the running Agent instance. Must be 16 bytes, generated using UUID v7. Must be set on every message. |                                                              |
| `sequence_num`                | Stable      | Done                  | Monotonically incrementing counter (by 1 per message) so the Server can detect missed messages. |                                                              |
| `agent_description`           | Stable      | Done                  | Describes the Agent: its type, version, OS, and where it runs. Should be omitted if unchanged since last message. |                                                              |
| `capabilities`                | Stable      | Done                  | Bitmask of `AgentCapabilities` flags declaring what the Agent supports. Must always be set. |  |
| `health`                      | Beta        | Done                   | Current health of the Agent and its sub-components. May be omitted if unchanged since last message. | Basic Fluent API interrogation is used |
| `effective_config`            | Stable      | ToDo                  | The Agent's current active configuration (may differ from the remote config). Should be omitted if unchanged since last message. | We use the metrics to get health of sources. |
| `remote_config_status`        | Stable      | Long Term             | Status of the last remote configuration received from the Server. Should be omitted if unchanged since last message. |                                                              |
| `package_statuses`            | Beta        | Not Planned           | List of Agent packages and their installation/update statuses. Should be omitted if unchanged since last message. | Makes more sense with Fluentd as greater package portfolio   |
| `agent_disconnect`            | Stable      | Done             | Must be set in the last `AgentToServer` message before the Agent disconnects. |                                                              |
| `**flags**`                   | Stable      | Done             | Bitmask of `AgentToServerFlags`. Currently includes `RequestInstanceUid` to ask the Server to assign a new instance UID. |                                                              |
| `connection_settings_request` | Development | Long Term             | A request from the Agent to initiate creation of new connection settings (agent-initiated CSR flow). |                                                              |
| `custom_capabilities`         | Development | Done                  | Declares custom/extension capabilities supported by this Agent. | This is support the ChatOps concept. Documentation provided on how to add your own. |
| `custom_message`              | Development | Done                  | An arbitrary custom message sent from the Agent to the Server, scoped to a declared custom capability. | This is support the ChatOps concept                          |
| `available_components`        | Development | Not Planned           | Lists the components available in the Agent. Should only be set when `ReportsAvailableComponents` capability is declared. |                                                              |
| `connection_settings_status`  | Development | Not Planned           | Reports the status of connection settings previously offered by the Server. Should be omitted if unchanged since last message. | This would be invasive to Fluent Bit                         |



### Server to Client

Here's the markdown table for `ServerToAgent` message fields:

| Field                  | Spec Status | Implementation Status | Spec Description                                             | Implementation Notes                |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `instance_uid`         | Stable      | Done                  | The Agent instance identifier. Must match the `instance_uid` previously received in the `AgentToServer` message. Used to route messages when multiple Agents share a single connection. |                                     |
| `error_response`       | Stable      | Done                  | Set when the Server encountered an error processing an `AgentToServer` message. When set, all other fields (except `instance_uid`) must be unset. |                                     |
| `remote_config`        | Stable      | Long Term             | Set when the Server has a remote configuration offer for the Agent. |                                     |
| `connection_settings`  | Beta        | Long Term             | Set when the Server wants the Agent to change one or more client connection settings (destination, headers, certificate, etc.). |                                     |
| `packages_available`   | Beta        | Not Planned           | Set when the Server has packages to offer to the Agent for download/installation. |                                     |
| `**flags**`            | Stable      | Partial                  | Bitmask of `ServerToAgentFlags`. Includes `ReportFullState` (asks Agent to resend full status, e.g. after Server restart) and `ReportAvailableComponents` (asks Agent to send full component details rather than just a hash). |                                     |
| `capabilities`         | Stable      | Done                  | Bitmask of `ServerCapabilities` flags. Must be set in the first `ServerToAgent` message; may be omitted (set to 0) in subsequent messages. |                                     |
| `agent_identification` | Stable      | Done            | Used to override the Agent's `instance_uid`. When `new_instance_uid` is set, the Agent must adopt it for all further communication. |                                     |
| `**command**`          | Beta        | Done                  | Set when the Server wants the Agent to perform a command (currently only `Restart`). When set, all fields other than `instance_uid` and `capabilities` are ignored. |                                     |
| `custom_capabilities`  | Development | Done                 | Declares custom/extension capabilities supported by the Server. | This is support the ChatOps concept |
| `custom_message`       | Development | Done                | An arbitrary custom message sent from the Server to the Agent, scoped to a declared custom capability. | This is support the ChatOps concept |

Connection settings policy note:

- We intentionally do not support `ReportsOwnTraces`, `ReportsOwnMetrics`, or `ReportsOwnLogs` as direct connection-settings management features in this project.
- See the configuration policy in [consumer/README.md](../consumer/README.md#connection-settings).
	
## Immediate ToDos


### Server Side
* Implement the socket connection control (Duplicate WebSockets Connections) where a disconnect is sent if a client appears to connect more than once on a socket.


## Future Features

### Server & Client
* GitHub driven test rig including validating against 3rd party server or client implementation for functional behavior tests.
* Docs on [readthedocs](https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/#/community)
* Handshake for bearer token allocation and [mTLS](https://goteleport.com/learn/what-is-mtls/)

### Client Side
* Allow consumer attributes to come from commenting block in Fluent Bit configuration
* extend so configuration can be classic Fluent Bit
* share namespace when running in a K8s deployment

  

### Server Side
* Extend persistence mechanism beyond initial file mechanism.
* Load configurations and distribute to relevant nodes
* Certificate management - this is messy to setup and test properly
