# Shared Utilities

This folder is the canonical source for cross-project OpAMP utility modules.

## What changed

To make the provider wheel self-contained, the provider now vendors copies of
runtime-required modules under:

- `provider/src/shared/`

The provider package no longer relies on an external `opamp-shared` dependency
at runtime.

## Why this was done

Provider code imports:

- `from shared.opamp_config import ...`
- `from shared.uuid_utils import ...`
- `from shared.sbom import ...`

When provider was launched in some MCP/client contexts, `shared` could be
missing from import resolution, leading to:

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shared'`

Vendoring `shared` inside `provider/src` ensures those imports are present in
the built provider wheel artifact and in source-based launches that set
`PYTHONPATH` to `provider/src`.

## Sync note

`shared/` remains the source of truth.

Provider runtime vendoring currently applies to:

- `shared/opamp_config.py`
- `shared/uuid_utils.py`

Mirror runtime-required changes into:

- `provider/src/shared/`

For standalone MCP package builds, a vendored copy of the shared SBOM helper is
also kept under:

- `mcp/src/shared/sbom.py`

That vendored copy exists only so the packaged `opamp-mcp-config` wheel remains
self-contained. The canonical implementation lives in:

- `shared/sbom.py`
