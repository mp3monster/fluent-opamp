# ST-004 Keycloak Authentication Containers

This folder contains the runnable ST-004 local scenario for provider
authentication with Keycloak. It turns the dev-note scenario into a Docker
Compose harness that can be run from a checkout without external SaaS services.

Run the scenario:

```bash
tests/test-containers/st004/scripts/run_st004.sh
```

The script builds the runtime image, starts Keycloak, starts the authenticated
provider, starts one valid simulator consumer, starts one wrong-audience
simulator consumer, verifies the route matrix, captures logs, and tears the
compose project down.

## What Starts

- `keycloak`: local Keycloak with the imported `opamp` realm.
- `provider`: OpAMP provider with `opamp-use-authorization=idp`,
  `ui-use-authorization=idp`, and `allow-mcp=true`.
- `consumer-valid`: simulator consumer using Keycloak client credentials with
  the `opamp-consumer` audience.
- `consumer-wrong-audience`: simulator consumer using a valid Keycloak token
  signed by the same realm but with the wrong audience.

By default the containers retrieve source from the mounted local checkout using
`git ls-files`, so uncommitted tracked source changes are included while ignored
runtime folders are not. Set `ST004_USE_LOCAL_SOURCE=false` to clone from
`ST004_SOURCE_REPO` and `ST004_SOURCE_REF` instead.

## Verification

`scripts/verify_st004.py` checks:

- Keycloak client-credentials tokens can be acquired for UI, OpAMP, and
  wrong-audience clients.
- `/ui` rejects missing and wrong-audience bearer tokens.
- `/ui` accepts the UI-scope Keycloak token.
- `/api/clients` accepts the UI-scope Keycloak token.
- `/tool/otelAgents` accepts the UI-scope Keycloak token and exposes the valid
  simulator agent.
- `/v1/opamp` rejects missing and wrong-audience bearer tokens.
- `/v1/opamp` accepts the OpAMP-scope Keycloak token and reaches the protocol
  handler.
- the valid simulator consumer registers with the provider.
- the wrong-audience simulator consumer does not register.
- `/mcp` rejects missing and wrong-audience bearer tokens.
- `/mcp` with a valid UI-scope token reaches the MCP transport rather than
  being rejected by auth.

Evidence is written under:

```text
dist/test-reports/st004/keycloak/
```

The primary review file is `results.md`; raw route matrix, API captures, and
the wrong-audience consumer log are written beside it as evidence.

## Ports

Defaults:

| Service | Host port | Container port |
|---|---:|---:|
| Keycloak | `18082` | `8080` |
| Provider | `18083` | `8080` |

Override them when needed:

```bash
ST004_KEYCLOAK_PORT=19082 ST004_PROVIDER_PORT=19083 \
  tests/test-containers/st004/scripts/run_st004.sh
```

## Notes

This scenario intentionally uses HTTP inside the compose network. It is focused
on Keycloak/JWT route protection, not TLS. The broader ST-004 dev-note still
describes TLS coverage as a related profile.
