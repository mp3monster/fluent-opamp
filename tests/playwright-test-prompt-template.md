# Playwright Test Prompt Template

Use this template when asking Codex to create or update Playwright tests for `config-service/ui-tests/config-ui.spec.js`.

## Prompt Template

```text
Create Playwright test(s) for <feature or bug> in the Config Editor.

Context:
- Page: /config-service/ui
- Config type/version context: <fluentbit/fluentd and version if relevant>
- Current behavior: <what happens now>
- Expected behavior: <what should happen>

Test scope:
- Add test(s) to: config-service/ui-tests/config-ui.spec.js
- Use existing test style and selectors from that file.
- Keep tests deterministic and avoid timing flakiness.

Steps to automate:
1. <step 1>
2. <step 2>
3. <step 3>

Assertions:
- <assertion 1>
- <assertion 2>
- <assertion 3>

Constraints:
- Do not change config type/version unless the scenario requires it.
- Prefer role/name selectors for buttons and explicit CSS ids for fields.
- If needed, add/extend fixture files under config-service/ui-tests/fixtures.

Deliverables:
- Implement test code.
- Run `npm run ui:test -- --list` and confirm test is discovered.
- Summarize what was added and which file/lines changed.
```

## Example 1: Plugin Appears Immediately

```text
Create a Playwright regression test for plugin add behavior.

Context:
- Page: /config-service/ui
- Config type/version context: default Fluent Bit startup state
- Current behavior: plugin was not showing until changing type or version
- Expected behavior: plugin appears in plugin list immediately after Add Plugin

Test scope:
- Add test to config-service/ui-tests/config-ui.spec.js

Steps to automate:
1. Capture current values of #config-type-select and #version-select.
2. Select plugin section `inputs`.
3. Read currently selected value from #plugin-name.
4. Click "Add Plugin".

Assertions:
- #plugin-list contains the selected plugin name.
- #config-type-select value is unchanged.
- #version-select value is unchanged.
```

## Example 2: Mode Switch Panel Visibility

```text
Create a Playwright test to validate panel visibility when switching configuration type.

Context:
- Page: /config-service/ui
- Switch from Fluent Bit to Fluentd
- Expected behavior: Add Plugin panel hides, Labels and Workers panels show

Steps to automate:
1. Assert #add-plugin-panel is visible initially.
2. Assert #labels-panel and #workers-panel are hidden initially.
3. Change #config-type-select to fluentd.

Assertions:
- #add-plugin-panel is hidden.
- #labels-panel is visible.
- #workers-panel is visible.
```

## Example 3: Client Error Reporting

```text
Create a Playwright test to verify browser console errors are posted to backend.

Context:
- Page: /config-service/ui
- Endpoint: /config-service/api/v1/client-errors

Steps to automate:
1. Wait for a POST request matching /client-errors.
2. Trigger `console.error("playwright synthetic console error")` via page.evaluate.

Assertions:
- A POST request to /client-errors is captured.
- Request body contains `playwright synthetic console error`.
```

## Quick Tips

- Prefer assertions against stable IDs such as `#plugin-list`, `#parser-format`, `#yaml-output`.
- Use `await expect(...).toBeVisible()` or `toContainText()` instead of manual sleeps.
- Keep one behavior per test unless the flow is tightly coupled.
- Name tests in behavior language: `"<action> <expected result>"`.
