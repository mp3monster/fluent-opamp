# CLI Demo Mode And Dev Flags

This note documents two behavior switches used by the OpAMP CLI and nearby consumer workflows:

- `OPAMP_DEMO`
- `APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES`

This file is intentionally kept as a standalone CLI note rather than being linked from the main project docs.

## `OPAMP_DEMO`

`OPAMP_DEMO` is the flag that enables demo-specific guided options in `opamp-cli`.

When it is set to a truthy value such as `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`, the CLI adds profile-based demo actions to guided `start` and `stop`.

The current profile lookup file is:

- `cli/config/demo_consumer_profiles.json`

Each profile in that file provides:

- a logical profile name
- an optional `scenario_description`
- a consumer simulator instances file
- a Fluent Bit OpAMP config path
- a Fluent Bit agent config path
- a Fluentd OpAMP config path
- a Fluentd agent config path
- an Elastic Agent OpAMP config path
- an Elastic Agent config path
- optional container start commands

When `OPAMP_DEMO` is enabled:

- `opamp-cli start` includes `Demo consumers (<profile-name>)` entries
- `opamp-cli stop` includes matching demo stop entries
- `opamp-cli demo` acts as shorthand for `opamp-cli start demo consumers`
- `start demo consumers` acts as a category selector and offers the named profiles from the lookup file
- the guided selector accepts `d<number>` so the scenario description can be viewed before choosing a profile
- demo-launched process records are written into `cli/runtime/managed_processes.json`
- those records are profile-scoped, so one demo profile can be stopped independently of another
- profiles can start configured containers before consumers, so dependency services such as Logstash can come up first

The `Demo setup (Elastic Agent self-monitoring to Logstash)` profile uses:

- `tests/logstash/opamp-consumer-elastic-agent-logstash-plugin.json`
- `tests/logstash/elastic-agent.yml`
- the `logstash-local` container entry from `cli/config/demo_consumer_profiles.json`

The launch sequence is:

1. Start the configured Logstash container on host port `5044`.
2. Start `opamp_consumer.client` with the Elastic Agent consumer config.
3. The consumer loads the `elastic_agent` plugin and launches Elastic Agent with the self-monitoring YAML.
4. Elastic Agent sends its monitoring logs and metrics to local Logstash.

## `APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES`

`APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES` is not a CLI-only flag. It is a broader runtime flag used by development-oriented workflows.

In the CLI-related area, it currently matters most for simulator-oriented startup paths.

Current use:

- the simulator launcher wrappers set it before starting consumer-sim
- the CLI demo-consumer start flow sets it for the simulator start step
- interactive CLI startup reports it when it is already enabled in the current environment

Relevant CLI behavior:

- demo profile starts set `APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=true` when invoking `consumer-sim`
- startup messaging in interactive CLI only mentions this flag when it is actually detected as enabled
- when the Fluent Bit dev-generator scripts are present, `opamp-cli dev-flb-config` is exposed as a guided developer workflow
- `opamp-cli dev-pid-lookup` is exposed as a dev-only workflow for regex-based running-process PID lookup
- `opamp-cli dev-containers` is exposed when a supported container runtime and configured container starts are available
- the Fluent Bit workflow discovers tool metadata from:
  - `config-service/dev-tools/generate_fluentbit_assets.py`
  - `config-service/dev-tools/generate_fluentbit_markdown.py`
- the CLI uses the metadata exported by those scripts to keep prompts and supported flags aligned with the tools themselves

One important non-CLI interaction is the security checks flow:

- `scripts/security_checks.py` explicitly removes `APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES` from the environment before running checks

That keeps validation runs aligned with non-dev behavior.

## CLI Replacements

The CLI now covers the main lifecycle operations that older wrapper scripts previously handled. Those workflows can be performed with:

- `opamp-cli start simulator`
- `opamp-cli stop simulator`
- `opamp-cli start fluentbit client`
- `opamp-cli stop fluentbit client`
- `opamp-cli start fluentd client`
- `opamp-cli stop fluentd client`
- `opamp-cli dev-containers logstash`

## Scripts That Should Not Be Treated As Direct CLI Replacements

The following scripts still have distinct behavior and should not be grouped into the removal list just because the CLI now covers much of the normal consumer lifecycle:

- `scripts/start_fluentd.sh`
- `scripts/start_fluentd.cmd`
- `scripts/terminate_fluent_bit.sh`
- `scripts/terminate_fluent_bit.cmd`

Why they are different:

- `start_fluentd.*` starts Fluentd directly, not the OpAMP consumer wrapper flow
- `terminate_fluent_bit.*` is an emergency direct process terminator for `fluent-bit`

Those may still be useful as low-level operational helpers even if the CLI becomes the primary entrypoint.
