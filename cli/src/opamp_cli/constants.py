HELP_TEXT = """Usage:
  opamp-cli
  opamp-cli script <output_name> <command...>
  opamp-cli <command...>
  opamp-cli help
  opamp-cli list
  opamp-cli status
  opamp-cli demo
  opamp-cli enable-process-tail
  opamp-cli disable-process-tail
  opamp-cli dev-flb-config
  opamp-cli dev-mcp-config
  opamp-cli dev-pid-lookup

Behavior:
  - Interactive `start`, `stop`, and `restart` commands open guided multi-stage choices.
  - `list` shows the current CLI option hierarchy and guided targets.
  - `status` shows recorded managed processes, PID liveness, and log paths.
  - `enable-process-tail` opens a new shell tailing each managed process log after start.
  - If first token is `script`, generate an OS-native script file.
  - Otherwise execute the command immediately.
  - Direct `.py`/`.pyw` targets are auto-run via Python.

Examples:
  # Start server
  opamp-cli start server

  # Start catalog
  opamp-cli start catalog

  # Stop server
  opamp-cli stop server

  # Stop all CLI-managed processes
  opamp-cli stop all

  # Restart server
  opamp-cli restart server

  # Show managed process status
  opamp-cli status

  # Show current command/target hierarchy
  opamp-cli list

  # Open demo profile choices when OPAMP_DEMO=true
  opamp-cli demo

  # Enable log tail windows for future managed starts
  opamp-cli enable-process-tail

  # Open the dev-only Fluent Bit generator workflow
  opamp-cli dev-flb-config

  # Open the dev-only MCP client configuration workflow
  opamp-cli dev-mcp-config

  # Prompt for a regex and search running process IDs
  opamp-cli dev-pid-lookup

Notes:
  - Interactive autocomplete uses prompt_toolkit when installed.
  - Fallback completion uses readline when available.
  - Guided actions can be run directly, for example `start config editor`.
  - When OPAMP_DEMO=true, `demo` acts like `start demo consumers`.
  - When APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=true and the Fluent Bit dev tools are present, `dev-flb-config` opens a guided generator workflow.
  - When APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=true and the MCP config utility is present, `dev-mcp-config` opens a guided MCP client configuration workflow.
  - When APP_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=true, `dev-pid-lookup` prompts for a regex and searches running processes for PID/name/command-line matches.
  - Guided start/stop/restart actions run components directly instead of relying on repo wrapper scripts.
  - Set OPAMP_DEMO=true to enable demo consumer options from cli/config/demo_consumer_profiles.json.
  - Guided starts record launched PIDs in cli/runtime/managed_processes.json.
  - Process-tail shells are opened on a best-effort basis and may be unavailable in headless terminals.
